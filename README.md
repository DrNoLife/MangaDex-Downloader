# MangaDex-Downloader

Currently, just a proof-of-concept Console application, used to quickly try and figure out how to use the MangaDex API.

Might develop it further in the future, in a desktop application using Avalonia to easily download mangas. But not sure. As of now, it's a proof-of-concept.
